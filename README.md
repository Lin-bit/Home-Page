Simple Home Page 
I started coding and this if my first "real project" I completed. I'm still learning and hope to build more projects soon. I apologize if the code looks messy, I'm still working on making it neat and easy to read. I'm open to any kind of feedback on it. My main issue I have is properly placing objects as you can see how often I use margins to get my content to where I want it. Again, any tips and advice would mean a lot to me. I struggle with creativity and design so it took me a while to accept this page I created.
